"""mysite URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""

# The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters
# include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends
# the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.

# The idea behind include() is to make it easy to plug-and-play URLs. Since forum are in
# their own URLconf (forum/urls.py), they can be placed under “/forum/”, or under “/fun_polls/”,
# or under “/content/forum/”, or any other path root, and the app will still work.


from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('forum/', include('forum.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
